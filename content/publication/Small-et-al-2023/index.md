abstract: In preschool settings, ample evidence has long existed that some administrators and educators rely heavily on exclusionary practices to address unwanted behaviors despite evidence they are ineffective. There is a need for evidence-based interventions that provide teachers with skills to foster positive student–teacher relationships, teach students skills that result in positive interactions with teachers and peers, and provide opportunities to practice new skills during daily classroom interactions. First Step Next (FSN) is a short-term, multi-component Tier 2 intervention that helps address these needs. The current study examines the extent to which the immediate, post-intervention effects were maintained after the FSN intervention was delivered in preschool classrooms in the U.S. Results provide evidence that initial, post-intervention gains reported for social skills, problem behavior, student–teacher conflict, and relational aggression domains were maintained for 2 months post-intervention. The current study adds to the evidence base suggesting that FSN is a promising alternative to exclusionary discipline as its’ implementation addresses several factors contributing to continued reliance on these ineffective approaches such as (a) the escalation of conflicts with students with challenging behavior, (b) failure to anticipate and defuse problem situations, (c) unclear communication of behavioral expectations, and (d) unskilled use of teacher directives.
