abstract: "**Purpose**: Few cost-effectiveness studies have been conducted on social-emotional interventions for students in preschool settings. The current study is a cost-effectiveness analysis of the First Step Next (FSN) intervention for preschool students. **Method**: Our approach involved a secondary analysis of a randomized control trial that utilized the ingredients method to estimate costs (Levin & McEwan, 2001). In addition, effect sizes were used to generate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios representing the cost of improving student outcomes by one standard deviation (1 SD). **Results**: FSN was more cost-effective for improving behavior in the school setting than in the home setting, with an average cost per 1 SD improvement of $3,833 and $6,329, respectively. Additionally, the intervention had greater cost-effectiveness for social skill-related outcomes than problem behavior-related outcomes among preschool students. **Discussion**: This study advances our understanding of the costs and outcomes of practices designed to improve the school success of our youngest learners."
