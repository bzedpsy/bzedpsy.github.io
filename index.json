In the linear case, identification of the causal direction of effect relies on non-normality of variables. The reason for this is that under non-normality, asymmetry in variable distributions, error distributions, and independence structures of cause and error exist that allow one to probe whether a causal model of the from x → y or the reverse causation model y → x better approximates the underlying causal mechanism. In contrast, for non-linear variable relations, no distributional assumptions are required, and causal model identification relies on asymmetry of the independence structure of predictors and of competing models, provided that errors are additive. However, in practice, variables may be non-normal and non-linearly related to each other, and errors may be multiplicative. Thus, the present chapter discusses linearizable non-linear models for which distributional and independence-based direction dependence measures are applicable. Simulation results suggest that direction of dependence properties of linearized models allows one to identify the direction of causation for a variety of non-linear functional forms. An empirical example is given, and assumptions for model identification and extensions are discussed.","tags":null,"title":"Direction of dependence in non-linear models via linearization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S Konstantopoulos","W Li","B Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1727740800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1727740800,"objectID":"0d3e29176b6f7cb3ee91e93ea0458005","permalink":"https://bzedpsy.github.io/publication/sk-wl-zhang-2024/","publishdate":"2024-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sk-wl-zhang-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"This chapter focuses on a priori statistical power analysis in multilevel field experiments. Specifically, statistical power methods in two- and three-level cluster and block randomized designs are outlined. Altogether five experimental designs (two cluster and three block randomized) are defined. The sample size at the top level (e.g., schools) has a stronger impact on power than sample sizes at lower levels (e.g., classrooms, students) regardless of the type of the design. The magnitude of the treatment effect is positively related to power, and as the magnitude of the effect size increases, power increases as well. Clustering captured through intraclass correlations is inversely related to power, and thus decreases in clustering correspond to increases in power. Covariates that explain a considerable amount of the variance (e.g., ≥50%) at different levels increase power. In cluster designs, top-level covariates have a stronger influence on power compared to lower-level covariates (assuming cluster-mean centering). Power is typically larger in block randomized designs compared to cluster randomized designs. The two most powerful of the five designs seem to be the two-level block randomized design and the three-level block randomized design where the treatment is assigned at the bottom level.","tags":null,"title":"Statistical power in cross-sectional multilevel experiments in education","type":"publication"},{"authors":["B Zhang","F Huang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1727740800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1727740800,"objectID":"bad6731af168eee4ca6e9bf608788e35","permalink":"https://bzedpsy.github.io/publication/zhang-huang-2024/","publishdate":"2024-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhang-huang-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"Traditional multilevel models are commonly used to analyze multilevel data with a pure nested structure. However, cross-classified data structures are present when observations are nested within two higher-level structures which in turn are not nested within each other. To capture the variations from both clustering dimensions, cross-classified random effects models (CCREMs) were developed as an extension to standard multilevel modeling. Alternatively, simpler linear regression models with cluster-robust standard errors (CRSEs) can also be effective when analyzing cross-classified data structures. However, CRSEs can be underestimated when the number of clusters is small. The present chapter extends the use of a small sample adjustment approach (i.e., CR2) of CRSEs when used with cross-classified data structures (i.e., two-way OLS-CR2) and investigates its performance under various conditions. Simulation results showed that two-way OLS-CR2 can be used for both complete and partial cross-classified data with at least 30 clusters in one of two clustering dimensions.

There is a need for evidence-based interventions that provide teachers with skills to foster positive student–teacher relationships, teach students skills that result in positive interactions with teachers and peers, and provide opportunities to practice new skills during daily classroom interactions. First Step Next (FSN) is a short-term, multi-component Tier 2 intervention that helps address these needs. The current study examines the extent to which the immediate, post-intervention effects were maintained after the FSN intervention was delivered in preschool classrooms in the U.S. Results provide evidence that initial, post-intervention gains reported for social skills, problem behavior, student–teacher conflict, and relational aggression domains were maintained for 2 months post-intervention. The current study adds to the evidence base suggesting that FSN is a promising alternative to exclusionary discipline as its’ implementation addresses several factors contributing to continued reliance on these ineffective approaches such as (a) the escalation of conflicts with students with challenging behavior, (b) failure to anticipate and defuse problem situations, (c) unclear communication of behavioral expectations, and (d) unskilled use of teacher directives.","tags":null,"title":"Maintenance Effects for Preschool Students Participating in First Step Next","type":"publication"},{"authors":["AJ Frey","JW Small","B Zhang","S Bates","MR Kuklinski","HM Walker","EG Feil"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1697673600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1697673600,"objectID":"908ca991e333774a452f9e28ab60fea4","permalink":"https://bzedpsy.github.io/publication/frey-et-al-2023/","publishdate":"2023-10-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/frey-et-al-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"**Purpose**: Few cost-effectiveness studies have been conducted on social-emotional interventions for students in preschool settings.

The resulting algorithm can discover subpopulations with potentially varying magnitude and causal direction of effects under mild parameter inequality assumptions. Feasibility conditions are described and results from synthetic data experiments are presented suggesting that large effects and large sample sizes are beneficial for detecting causally competing subgroups with acceptable statistical performance.

When estimating and probing causal effects using observational data, covariate adjustment is a crucial element to remove dependencies between focal predictors and the error term. Covariate selection, however, constitutes a challenging task because availability alone is not an adequate criterion to decide whether a covariate should be included in the statistical model. The present study introduces a non-Gaussian method for covariate selection and provides a forward selection algorithm for linear models (i.e., non-Gaussian Forward Selection; nGFS) to select appropriate covariates from a set of potential control variables to avoid inconsistent and biased estimators of the causal effect of interest. Further, we demonstrate that the forward selection algorithm has properties compatible with principles of direction of dependence, i.e., probing whether the causal target model is correctly specified with respect to the causal direction of effects. Results of a Monte-Carlo simulation study suggest that the selection algorithm performs well, in particular, when sample sizes are large (i.e., n ≥ 250), and data strongly deviate from Gaussianity (e.g., distributions with skewnesses beyond 1.5).

In addition to studying \"average treatment effects\", the evaluation of \"distributional treatment effects\", (i.e., effects that go beyond means), has been suggested to obtain a broader picture of how an intervention affects the study outcome. We continue this discussion by considering distributional causal effects. We present formal definitions of causal effects that go beyond means and utilize a distributional regression framework known as generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS). GAMLSS allows one to characterize an intervention effect in its totality through simultaneously modeling means, variances, skewnesses, kurtoses, as well as ceiling and floor effects of outcome distributions. Based on data from a large-scale randomized controlled trial, we use GAMLSS to evaluate the impact of a teacher classroom management program on student academic performance. Results suggest the teacher classroom management training increased mean academic competence as well as the chance to obtain the maximum score on the academic competence scale. These effects would have been completely overlooked in a traditional evaluation of mean aggregates.","tags":null,"title":"Distributional Causal Effects: Beyond an “Averagarian” View of Intervention Effects","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Y-R Chuang","FL Huang","KC Herman","B Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1661990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661990400,"objectID":"a613234fe928a2847cfde618684d46e1","permalink":"https://bzedpsy.github.io/publication/chuang-et-al-2022/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chuang-et-al-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Positive perceptions of school climate are associated with improved academic and behavioral outcomes, such as lower bullying victimization experience and higher student engagement.

Although the traditional robust standard errors used with MLMs require at least 50 clusters to be effective, we assess a robust standard error adjustment (i.e., the CR2 estimator) that can be used even with a few clusters. Findings are assessed using a Monte Carlo simulation and are further illustrated using an applied example.

You can focus on the content and Wowchemy handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you’ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Wowchemy.\nExamples Code Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can customize the styles under the syntax_highlighter option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() ``` renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() Mindmaps Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.\nSimply insert a Markdown markmap code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.\nA simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:\n```markmap {height=\u0026#34;200px\u0026#34;} - Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal ``` renders as\n- Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal A more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:\n```markmap - Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ ``` renders as\n- Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ Charts Wowchemy supports the popular Plotly format for interactive charts.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example line-chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026#34;line-chart\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\nYou might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy math shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$ Example inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$ f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases} $$ Diagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ``` renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
